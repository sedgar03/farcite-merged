# farcite-merged

### Current Status
Trying to get Lexical into my memo writer

### Old Notes:

Deployment from this branch is successful as I'm using both the build and deploy commands.  Replit is currently struggling (and may be unable to) allow for backend requests within the same repo - so these may need to be split out

To switch between local and deployment do the following:
- Remove "exposeLocalhost = true" to hide this port

https://docs.replit.com/extensions/development/full-stack

Note - To run this, spin up two repls and run the front-end in one and the back end in the other
