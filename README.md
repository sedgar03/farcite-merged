# farcite-merged


Deployment from this branch is successful as I'm using both the build and deploy commands.  Replit is currently struggling (and may be unable to) allow for backend requests within the same repo - so these may need to be split out

To switch between local and deployment do the following:
- Remove "exposeLocalhost = true" to hide this port
